```

The idea to shift the characteristics of the game to be _submarines_ instead of _battleships_ due to the nature that the player can see board boards simoultaneously.

When the program begins to run, players are asked to position 5 Submarines on the board:

```

AT THE START OF THE GAME, YOU WILL BE ASKED TO POSITION 5 SUBS
              LIKE THIS:
                     pick a lettered column between A - H:
              THEN LIKE THIS:
                      pick a numbered row between 1 - 5:

```

Once all 5 submarines are positioned, the game employs the same function to guess the coordinates of the computer's hidden submarines (it also has 5 submarines).

once a player's /computer's submarines have all been targeted, the game is over and a win/loss message is generated, supplemented with the otpion to start a new game.

**This project is the third of the five projects to be created for the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development (Common Curriculum)**

Based on the Learning outcomes of the section of the Diploma, this project aims to:

1. Create an interactive game through a _"given algorithm as a computer program"_ 
2. Run a game of ` S U B M A R I N E ██ D O M I N A T I O N ` by _"Adapting and combining algorithms"_ to solve the processes and problem solving operations generated by the game's programming
3. Utilise _"standard programming constructs: repetition, selection, functions, composition, modules, aggregated data (arrays, lists, etc.)"_ to effictively run the game
4. _"Explain what the given program does"_ in it's code through effective commenting and docstrings
5. Using the project creation process to _"Identify and repair coding errors in a program"_
6. Create a Project that uses _"library software for building a graphical user interface, or command-line interface, or web application, or mathematical software"_
7. create a project that _"implements a data model, application features and business logic"_ and utilises these to generate easily recognisable responses and outcomes for users/players.
8. Create a Project that is developed through a documented process _"through a version control system such as **GitHub©**"_
9. Be Deployed on **Heroku©**

External user’s goal:
The application user wants to play a logic game
Site owner's goal:

The Battleships game is played on grids on which each player's fleet of battleships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players call shots at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.
The application provides a working battleships game for a single user to play against the computer .e.g.
Potential features to include:

The ability for the user to set the grid size
Warn the user if their guess is off-grid

|`LO5	Identify and repair coding errors in a program`|
|`LO6	Use library software for building a graphical user interface, or command-line interface, or web application, or mathematical software`|
|`LO7	Implement a data model, application features and business logic to manage, query and manipulate data to meet given needs in a particular real-world domain.`|
|`LO8	Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system such as GitHub`|
|`L09	Deploy a command-line application to a cloud-based platform`|

# Bugs

known Bugs

resolved*

1. Since debugging, this error has not been replicated. it was suspected that; upon defeat by the computer, the program would not exit the `while loop` that ran the core gameplay loop, resulting in an error throwing when it was trying to run the `while loop` on values which no longer had a value as the game had been restarted:

|`Just had a little play looks great but did encounter an error that kicked me out. I think the coordinate i hit to get this was C1. I have added  a screenshot of the IndexError this caused.`|

After consultation with The project mentor (Seun Owonikoko), the above explanation was expected. at this stage, the bug has been removed by implementing a `break` of the `loop` upon `player_shipcount` decreasing to `0`

Welcome Cal-Rex,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **August 17, 2021**

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
